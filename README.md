# improved-stopwatch
An alternative solution to Shodors stopwatch with recorded times saved in localStorage. Created with Vanilla JS and Bootstrap.

### Stopwatch Features:

1. **Start/Stop Functionality:** The stopwatch can be started and stopped to measure elapsed time accurately.
2. **Record Timestamp:** Users can record timestamps while the stopwatch is running.
3. **Reset Timer:** A reset button allows users to reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00:00.
4. **Font Size Selection:** Users can choose from three font sizes (Normal, Large, and Huge) for the stopwatch display.
5. **Responsive Design:** The stopwatch scales responsively to fit all device sizes and orientations.
6. **Persistent Timer:** The timer value is stored in `localStorage`, ensuring it remains after page refreshes.
7. **Recorded Times Persistence:** Recorded timestamps are stored in `localStorage`, persisting across page reloads.
8. **Clear Recorded Times:** A "Clear" button clears all recorded timestamps from the display and `localStorage`.
9. **Stylish Design:** The stopwatch features a clean and visually appealing design, thanks to Bootstrap CSS.
10. **SVG Background:** The site uses an SVG background image that scales responsively on all devices from [Haikei](https://haikei.app/).
