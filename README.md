# improved-stopwatch
An alternative solution to [Shodor's](http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/Stopwatch/) stopwatch with recorded times stored in localStorage. Created with Vanilla JS and Bootstrap.

### Stopwatch Features:

1. **Start/Stop Functionality:** The stopwatch can be started and stopped to measure elapsed time accurately.
2. **Record Timestamp:** Users can record timestamps while the stopwatch is running.
3. **Reset Timer:** A reset button allows users to reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00:00.
4. **Font Size Selection:** Users can choose from three font sizes (Normal, Large, and Huge) for the stopwatch display.
5. **Responsive Design:** The stopwatch scales responsively to fit all device sizes and orientations.
6. **Persistent Timer:** The timer value is stored in `localStorage`, ensuring it remains after page refreshes.
7. **Recorded Times Persistence:** Recorded timestamps are stored in `localStorage`, persisting across page reloads.
8. **Clear Recorded Times:** A "Clear" button clears all recorded timestamps from the display and `localStorage`.
9. **Stylish Design:** The stopwatch features a clean and visually appealing design, thanks to Bootstrap CSS.
10. **SVG Background:** The site uses an SVG background image that scales responsively on all devices from [Haikei](https://haikei.app/).
11. **Download Timestamps:** Users can download the recorded timestamps locally to their device for further use or analysis.
12. **Set Time Manually:** Users can manually set the stopwatch time by editing the stopwatch display, which is contenteditable. This feature allows users to start the stopwatch from a specific time or continue timing from a previously recorded timestamp.
13. **Hotkey Functionality:** Press the Spacebar to start/stop the stopwatch and press R to record a timestamp.
